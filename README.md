In order to make sure the correct driver is running the Chrome browser:

Check the current version of your installed Chrome browser (... ---> Help ---> About Chrome)

Download the same version from this url: https://googlechromelabs.github.io/chrome-for-testing/

Place the chromedriver.exe here: C:\Work\Brainster\FinalProject-Lazar.Stojkovski\bin\Debug\net6.0
